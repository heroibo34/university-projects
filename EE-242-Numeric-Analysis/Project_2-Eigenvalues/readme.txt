Readme

In this project, we have looked the solution of f(x)=0 , the user should enter the coefficients and two number that the only one solution should be between these two number.Last input should be the tolerance. To start the project, command line argument should be correct.

Example
2 2 -7 1 -7 1.5 1.8 0.001This means that 2x^4 + 2x^3 - 7x^2 + x - 7 = 0 
Interval (1.5 , 1.8)
Tolerance 10^-3
